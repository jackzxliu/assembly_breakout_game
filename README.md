# assembly_breakout_game
Brick Breaker Game made in assembly for CSC258 Project

To Play: Download a MIPS simulator
I recommend Saturn by Taylor: https://github.com/1whatleytay/saturn/releases

Use the Assembly simulator to open the asm file.

Compile & Run the code.

Controls: A D for moving left/right. 
Space for selecting level/launching the ball. 
Q to go back to main menu or exit the game from main menu. 
P to pause/unpause the game.

There are three levels inspired by Pink Floyd's work. 

Enjoy!
